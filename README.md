Used Car Price Prediction in Sri Lanka
This project is a machine learning-based system designed to predict the price of used vehicles in Sri Lanka. With many brands and models available in the second-hand market, pricing can often be inconsistent. This tool helps buyers and sellers estimate a fair market value based on real data.

The model takes key car details such as brand, model, year of manufacture, engine capacity, gear type, and fuel type as input. These details are processed and converted into numerical form using label encoding, making them suitable for machine learning.

A regression algorithm (like Random Forest or Linear Regression) is trained on a dataset of nearly 10,000 used vehicle listings from Sri Lanka. This allows the model to learn how various features influence car prices and make accurate predictions.

The web application is built using Streamlit, providing a simple and interactive interface. Users can enter vehicle details and get an instant estimated price.

This tool is especially useful for individuals looking to buy or sell used cars, helping them make informed and fair pricing decisions in the local market.
